function RotMtx = matRad_eulerRot(phi,theta,psi)
% matRad_eulerRot Given the euler angles, this function generates the euler 
% rotation matrix.
% Explanation of euler angles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles
% In short, the system is turned around the z then x' then z'' axis.
%
% Positive angles -> turn axis
% Negative angles -> coordinate transformation
%
% call
%   RotMtx = eulerRot(phi,theta,psi)
%
% input
%   phi, theta, psi:    radian angles according to above definition
%
% output:
%   RotMx:              3x3 rotation matrix that performs euler rotation
